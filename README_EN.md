# DeepHarness — DeepSeek Harness for Obsidian

> **[中文版](./readme-ch.md) · [English](./README.md)**

A Claudian-style AI assistant plugin for Obsidian: it calls **DeepSeek Harness** directly from the side panel. Send a task to the chat window and the DSH agent works in your vault as its working directory, using its full toolset (bash, file read/write, web search, subagents, …) autonomously.

  <em>Feature showcase — send a task in the side panel, and the DeepSeek Harness agent works in your vault.</em>
</p>

> Design document: [`DESIGN.md`](./DESIGN.md). This repo was designed based on an analysis of
> [Enigmora/claudian](https://github.com/Enigmora/claudian); the key difference is that
> **execution is pushed down to the DSH runtime** — the plugin only bridges the process and renders the UI.

## How it works

```
Obsidian plugin ──spawn──▶ dsh --profile headless --patch <vault.yml> "<task>"
                            │ cwd = vault root
                            │ DSH_HOME = ~/.dsh (reuses your credentials/model config)
                            ▼
                    DeepSeek Harness agent
                    bash │ file tools │ web_search │ subagents …
```

Verified locally: `dsh --profile headless "use bash to run pwd and ls…"` works end-to-end.

## Prerequisites

1. Install the DSH CLI:

   ```bash
   npm i -g @deepseek-ai/dsh
   ```

2. Configure model credentials (either one):
   - DSH web (Models page) writes `~/.dsh/.credentials.yaml`
   - Or export the `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` environment variable

3. Click "Run check" on the plugin settings page to confirm `dsh` is detected.

## Installation

### From the Obsidian community plugin market (recommended)

1. Open Obsidian → **Settings → Community plugins**.
2. Turn off **Restricted mode** if needed.
3. Click **Browse**, then search for **DeepHarness**.
4. Click **Install**, then **Enable**.
5. Open **DeepHarness settings** and run the **Check** button to verify `dsh` is detected.

### From GitHub Release / source (development)

```bash
npm install
npm run build
# Copy into your vault:
cp -r dist /path/to/vault/.obsidian/plugins/deepharness/
```

After enabling the plugin, click the bot icon in the left ribbon to open the chat panel.

## Features

- 💬 **Chat panel**: send a task → status indicator (starting / thinking / elapsed) → Markdown-rendered result
- 🧠 **Model selector**: switch between **DeepSeek V4 Flash / DeepSeek V4 Pro** in the panel toolbar
- ⚙️ **Reasoning effort (Thinking)**: switch **off / high / max** in the toolbar
  - Written to the plugin-owned DSH_HOME (`dsh-home/` directory) via the `agent-default-model` config; credentials are symlinked from `~/.dsh` — the global DSH settings are **never polluted**
- ⏹ **Stop button** (SIGTERM) and a timeout fallback (default 10 minutes)
- 📝 **Conversation memory**: key points from earlier turns are automatically refilled into new tasks
- 🕘 **Session history**: conversations are archived per session; the history panel supports resume / pin / rename / note. The current session is atomically persisted after every turn — sessions that were not archived when Obsidian quit/crashed are restored into history on next launch, so nothing is lost
- 📋 **Copy / Save as note** in one click; UI text is selectable
- 🔗 **Reference current note**: the quote icon in the toolbar above the input inserts the note you are reading — if you have **text selected** in the note, the selection is inserted as a quoted block (auto-truncated with a source line); **without a selection** it inserts a bare wikilink (modeled after Claudian's New conversation)
- @ **Mention notes**: type `@` in the input box to search and reference any note in the vault — live title/path matching, inserted as `[[path]]` (scoped by the "Working directory" setting)
- ⚙️ **Command**: "Process current note"
- 🗂 **Generated vault persona** (`.obsidian/plugins/deepharness/generated/vault.yml`)
  instructs the agent to use wikilinks and ask before destructive operations; freely editable
- 🌐 **i18n UI** (English / 中文)

## Settings

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| dsh binary path | auto-detect | Empty = PATH |
| Node.js path | auto-detect | The plugin runs the dsh script with node directly (bypasses the shebang issue under Obsidian's restricted PATH) |
| DSH_HOME | `~/.dsh` | Credentials/config root |
| Plugin API key | empty | DeepSeek API key used ONLY by this plugin (separate from the desktop app); empty = reuse desktop credentials |
| Model provider | DeepSeek official API | deepseek-official = DeepSeek official API; opencode-go = OpenCode Go subscription (OpenAI-compatible, https://opencode.ai/zen/go/v1) |
| Working directory | vault root | Relative subfolder to scope the agent |
| Task timeout | 600s | Auto-stops the run when exceeded |
| Conversation memory | on | Context refill |
| Tool execution mode | default (native) | native / code / both (tool backend, not a file sandbox) |
| Model | DeepSeek V4 Flash | Default model; switchable from the panel toolbar. Vision Exp requires the OpenCode Go provider and ignores the reasoning effort setting |
| Reasoning effort | high | off / high / max; switchable from the toolbar |
| Security mode | workspace write | read-only / workspace write / full access |
| Show thinking | on | Collapsible thinking block before the answer |
| Show tool calls | on | Shows tool invocations (bash, file ops) as they run |
| History entries | 50 | Max sessions kept in the history panel; oldest removed first |
| Custom persona | empty | Extra instructions appended to the agent system prompt |

## Security

- The agent's file tools are scoped to the vault; **however the bash tool runs with user-level permissions** (headless has no file sandbox by default), so the persona rules require the agent not to modify files outside the vault and to ask before destructive operations
- Credentials go through existing DSH configuration by default (the plugin collects nothing); optionally you can set a plugin-only API key, which is stored in the local plugin data file and injected as an environment variable at run time — never shared with the desktop app
- All child processes are terminated when the plugin unloads

## Roadmap

- **Phase 2** (mostly done): streaming output, tool-call logs, persistent session history
  - Remaining: file-modification diff confirmation
- **Phase 3**: batch processing of vault notes, long-term memory (`Harness/memory.md`), run history
